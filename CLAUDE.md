# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is currently an empty git repository on the `testbranch` branch. The repository appears to be in the early stages of development with no code files currently present.

## Git Status

- **Current Branch**: `testbranch`
- **Recent Commit**: "加入e.txt文件" (added e.txt file) - though this file is not currently present
- **Status**: No staged changes, working directory is clean

## Development Setup

Since this is an empty repository, future development should begin by:
1. Adding project-specific files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
2. Establishing the project structure
3. Setting up build and development tools

## Branch Strategy

- Current working branch: `testbranch`
- Main branch appears to be unspecified (no main/master branch visible in recent commits)

## Notes

This repository appears to be in its initial setup phase. When code is added, this CLAUDE.md file should be updated to include:
- Build commands
- Test commands
- Project architecture
- Development workflow details
